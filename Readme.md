# Overview
The goal of this third group project is to finish your side-scrolling JavaScript game.

# Goals:

## Business Perspective:
* Visual Design: Make a game that will attract your intended audience to your website.
* User Interface Design: Make a game that lets users easily discover how to operate it.
* Business Considerations: If you wanted to collect revenue from your game by advertising on this website, how would design it so advertizing does not distract from the game, but, still allows customers to see it.
* Technical Implementation and Design: Make a game that's easy to understand how it work and easy for future developers to maintain.

## Objective Perspective:
* Implement Javascript and object oriented knowledge into the website
* Import and utilize clock function
* Understand object call and implementation between 3 relations (Javascript, css, and HTML)

# Future Improvements:
1. A lot of work still needs to be done!! I personally think that classes can still be structured and polished. (Too many global variables)
2. Nothing is bad from frame rates, but when the user plays for more than 2 minutes, the refresh rate becomes slower and slower (I think there is a memory leak somewhere, dont have time to fix this)
3. Character still needs improvement. I tried to create a spritesheet where the character can have a good animation but it does not work
4. Enemies need to be diversivy (not just Pikachu)
5. Add more level
6. Make it a multiplayer game

## Controller Design:
